# MiChaelCraft

## Dependencies
You will need these mods installed as well for MiChaelCraft to work:

* [Nbt Crafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-crafting)

## How to Install
1. Go to https://fabricmc.net/use/ and download the .JAR installer
2. Go to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and download the latest stable release
3. Go to https://github.com/FlyingTurtle69/michaelcraft/releases, click Assets then download the .jar file. 
4. Run the fabric installer .jar file, make sure the versions are the latest (not snapshot) and then click install.
5. Go to your `.minecraft` folder (in windows search type  `%appdata%`) and create a `mods` folder and drag the fabric api and MiChaelCraft jar files into it.

## Building From Source
If you want to build from the sourcecode, simply run `./gradlew build`

## Simping
You can create a Potion of Simping using a brewing stand with an Awkward Potion and a Pokimaine. You can then make splash and lingering potions and arrows from it like you normally would.

The Simping effect causes whatever is affected to drop its inventory for one minute (meaning it can't pick up any items as well). This effects players and mobs that can hold equipment like zombies or pillagers. You can basically tame a pillager using this.
