## Simping
You can create a Potion of Simping using a brewing stand with an Awkward Potion and a Pokimaine. You can then make splash and lingering potions and arrows from it like you normally would.

The Simping effect causes whatever is affected to drop its inventory for one minute (meaning it can't pick up any items as well). This effects players and mobs that can hold equipment like zombies or pillagers. You can basically tame a pillager using this.
